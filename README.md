# Webpage

In class we were instructed to create a webpage to describe the work that we did. Visit www.chrisostrouchov.com/classes/cpsc462 (not here yet) to see the webpage. Some of my highlights of creating the webpage include learning how to write single page applications. The website is powered by angularjs and uses bootstrap for nice css.
