# CPSC 462 Parallel Programming

This repository reflects all the work that was done in my cpsc 462 parallel programming class.

# Projects

Each folder in the repositories reflect a project that was asigned in class.

# Webpage

In class we were instructed to create a webpage to describe the work that we did. Visit www.chrisostrouchov.com/classes/cpsc462 to see the webpage. Some of my highlights of creating the webpage include learning how to write single page applications. The website is powered by angularjs and uses bootstrap for nice css.
