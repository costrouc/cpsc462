	  In this assignment we were required to write a program that
	  would read numbers from a given text file. For each number
	  read, the program would do a fake computation
	  taking <code>computeEffort</code> time. From this program we
	  collected timing data on files with 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64,
	  128, 256, and 512 numbers.
	</p>

	<h3>compute.c</h3> 

	<div ng-controller="textEditorController">
	  <div editor-text="http://cosc462.newton.utk.edu/costrouc/parallelProg01/compute.c"></div>
	</div>

	<p>
	  We can see from the file compute.h that <code>effort</code>
	  determines the amount of time that the
	  function <code>Compute(float effort)</code> waits. This is
	  accomplished using a function <code>nanosleep()</code>
	  provided in time.h.
	</p>

	<h3>readNumbers.c</h3>

	<p>
	  This file opens a file with given
	  name <code>filename</code>. All the proper file opening and
	  closing is preformed. Of interest is line 20. In the while
	  loop we can see that for each number read in it calls the
	  previously discussed <code>Compute(effort)</code>.
	</p>

	      Program readNumbers was run on text files with 1, 2, 4 , 8, 16, 32,

	<p>
	  Looking at Figure 1 we can see a very apparent linear
	  relationship between our data points. As the number of
	  numbers read in doubles the time appears to double as
	  well. This agrees with the algorithm that we have set
	  up in readNumbers.c . Since the program waits a constant
	  time <code>effort</code>, analysis of algorithms tells
	  us that the code should take O(N) time.

	  A program was written to generate n particles in a 2D space
	  and calculate statistics on those particles based on their
	  location. The statistics calculated on the particles include
	  the mean and variance of the positions, the distances
	  between two particles, and the inverse square distances
	  between two particles. The program takes three arguments as
	  input. <code>numParticles</code> determines the number of
	  particles to generate and calculate statistics
	  on. <code>shape</code> determines the container that the
	  particles need to fit within. It is required that the shape
	  be either a square or disk. Finally <code>radius</code>
	  determines the radius of the disk or half the side length
	  of the square.

	  Since the default time program provided from terminals in not
	  completely accurate on the real user time that is taken to run
	  a program a new one was written.  It takes the difference in
	  time when a program starts. As can be seen in serial of the
	  plots bellow this in not the most accurate at times.

	In this project we were to time our code with p processes on n
	nodes. For these test we ran on 1 to 6 nodes. Each node has 2
	cpus clocked at 2.8 GHz. Parameters that were used for timing
	the code were as follows:
	<br>
	numParticles 8000 <br>
	shape square <br>
	radius 1.0 <br>

	      This plot shows the run times for each process in p
	      processes run on n nodes. A least square polynomial of
	      degree 1 was fit to each plot. We can see as expected
	      the slope (also the expected job run time) decreases
	      proportionally to the the number of nodes
	      allocated. Also the associated cost of running more
	      processes than nodes can be interpreted as the constant
	      in each equation. This constant increases as the number
	      of nodes allocated increases.

	      Similar to the previous plot we have plotted the maximum

	Similary to Projects 5/6 we were to time our partice code that
	was written in class. However, the program was to be run on the
	newton cluster. Runnning code on the newton cluster is much
	different from running on our own clusters because we
	are <b>sharing</b> processing time with other users. To
	safeguard ourselves from using other peoples cores we reserved 8
	cores all on the same node. To bind our processes to the number
	of cores that were to be used we used a program
	called <code>Taskset</code>. The code was run on 1-8 cores. The
	parameters for particles: <br>
	numParticles 8000 <br>
	shape square <br>
	radius 1.0 <br>
