  <p>
    Since the default time program provided from terminals in not
    completely accurate on the real user time that is taken to run
    a program a new one was written.  It takes the difference in
    time when a program starts. As can be seen in serial of the
    plots bellow this in not the most accurate at times.

	This plot show the amount of time that it takes for a
	particle generation and statistics program to generate
	n particles and calculate the means and variances of
	the positions, distances, and inverse square
	distances.  This calculation is expected to be
	O(N^2). It is bumpy due to the round off error in
	timing. I am working to fix this error. This code was
	run on the Newton cluster.
