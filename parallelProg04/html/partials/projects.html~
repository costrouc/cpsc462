	Projects completed in COSC 462 are detailed below. A brief discussion
	of the programming and algorithms used for each project are discussed
	below. Further information on each project can be found on my

      This plot shows the amount of time that it takes to read in numbers from
      text files with n number of numbers. The program fakes that it is doing
      a hard computation for each number and waits computeEffort time. This
      calculation is expected to be O(N).

      This plot show the amount of time that it takes for a particle generation
      and statistics program to generate n particles and calculate the means
      and variaces of the positions, distances, and inverse square distances.
      This calculation is expected to be O(N^2).

      and statistics program to generate n particles and calculate the means
      and variaces of the positions, distances, and inverse square distances.
      This calculation is expected to be O(N^2). It is bumpy due to the roundoff error
      in timing. I am working to fix this error. This code was run on the Newton cluser.

      in the Min Kao building.
