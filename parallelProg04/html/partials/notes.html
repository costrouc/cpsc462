<h1>Notes on setup of cluster</h1>
<p>
  To setup the cluser I pretty much ran my whole opperation through google.
  Here are the steps that I went through to have an opperating cluster.

  Install opperating system (included sshd, ip address name)
  Use Yum to install python, git, openmpi-dev, tmux
  Add users costrouc (set passwd)
  Auto config for openmpi library
